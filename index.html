            <p>With the current situation of our Blue Planet, I'd propose a pessimistic outlook on humanity and say our
                species isn't sustaining life on Earth past the next few millenia. This is where the desire to expand
                life to Mars comes from. Now, skeptics would argue that with our current way of life, Mars, even if
                terraformed, would become Earth 2.0 and eventually abandonned. But let&apos;s not overthink things. In
                the meantime, let's embrace our dreams, take our imagination and explore this neighbouring planet as a
                glorious travel destination. ðŸš€</p>

                        <p>Mars get its red colour from a thin layer of Iron(II) Oxide rust. The planet is one of the
                            brightest objects in the Solar System and can be seen with the naked eyes, to the point
                            where astronomers from the ancient times were able to document its bright red glow long
                            before telescopes existed.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Time Moves Differently on Mars.</h3>
                        <p>A day on Mars is very similar in length to Earth, about 24 hours and 37 minutes long.
                            However, a year on Mars is almost twice as long since it orbits further away from the Sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>Just like Earth, Mars also has four seasons due to the scarily similar axial tilt (about 25
                            degrees) to Earth (23 degrees). Coupled with the longer Martian year, this makes each season
                            lasts about two times more.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Double Trouble.</h3>
                        <p>Unlike Earth, Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos, and they're less rounded like their next
                            door cousin. Phobos, the larger moon, is actually spiralling towards Mars and is predicted
                            to crash into the planet in about 50 million years.This is a spectacular,and quite frankly
                            terrifying, scenario but until then, let's book a trip.</p>
