            <p>With the current situation of our Blue Planet, I'd propose a pessimistic outlook on humanity and say our
                species isn't sustaining life on Earth past the next few millenia. This is where the desire to expand
                life to Mars comes from. Now, skeptics would argue that with our current way of life, Mars, even if
                terraformed, would become Earth 2.0 and eventually abandonned. But let&apos;s not overthink things. In
                the meantime, let's embrace our dreams, take our imagination and explore this neighbouring planet as a
                glorious travel destination. ðŸš€</p>

                        <p>Mars get its red colour from a thin layer of <span class="bold">Iron(II) Oxide</span> rust.
                            The planet is one of the
                            brightest objects in the Solar System and can be seen with the naked eyes, to the point
                            where astronomers from the ancient times were able to document its bright red glow long
                            before telescopes existed.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Time Moves Differently on Mars.</h3>
                        <p>A day on Mars is very similar in length to Earth, about 24 hours and 37 minutes long.
                            However, a year on Mars is almost twice as long since it orbits further away from the Sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>Just like Earth, Mars also has four seasons due to the scarily similar axial tilt (about 25
                            degrees) to Earth (23 degrees). Coupled with the longer Martian year, this makes each season
                            lasts about two times more.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Double Trouble.</h3>
                        <p>Unlike Earth, Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos, and they're less rounded than their next
                            door satellite cousin. Phobos, the larger moon, is actually spiralling towards Mars and is
                            predicted
                            to crash into the planet in about 50 million years. This is a spectacular, yet quite frankly
                            terrifying, sight to see.</p>

                <h2>Welcome to the age of space travelling.</h2>
                <p>With rapid technological advancements, our vision to expand into space is closer than ever. Humanity
                    could expect to attempt space travelling by the 2040s at the earliest, and once success is certain
                    the possibilities are endless. But first of all, a crucial question:</p>
                <h3>Why Mars?</h3>
                <p>While other planets are either gas giants, acidic wastelands, or freezing hellscapes, Mars stands out
                    as the most viable candidate for future colonization. A few reasons why:</p>
                <ul class="grid grid-2 grid-gap-20 pad-tb-20">
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">A relatively managable atmosphere:</span> Mars has a thin atmosphere made up
                        of mostly CO<sub>2</sub> gas, and while it's lacking oxygen, it's still a lighter lift to
                        transform habitable compared to other planets.</li>
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">Frozen water reserves:</span> Mars has ice caps at its poles, and there's
                        evidence of water in the form of ice and vapour in the planet's soil. This is a crucial element
                        for sustaining life (and opens up a whole new area on the study of previous or current life on Mars).</li>
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">A similar day-night cycle:</span>As mentioned, Mars has a day that's only 37 minutes
                        longer than Earth's, and a year that's almost twice as long. This makes it easier to adapt to
                        the Martian day-night cycle.</li>
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">Sustainable gravity:</span> Mars has a surface gravity of 
                        about 38% of Earth's. This is enough to prevent muscle and bone loss, but also light
                        enough to make it easier to travel and explore the planet.</li>
                </ul>
