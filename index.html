            <p>Given the current state of our Blue Planet, it's reasonable to predict that humanity may struggle to
                sustain life on Earth beyond the next few millennia. This prompted the great aspirational minds of our
                species to look to Mars as the next life frontier. Skeptics might argue that, with our current
                lifestyle, Marsâ€”if terraformedâ€”could become Earth 2.0 and eventually abandonned. However, let's not
                overthink this. For now, let's embrace our dreams, put hope into our imagination, and explore our
                neighbouring planet as a magnificent travel destination. ðŸš€</p>

                        <p>Mars get its red colour from a thin layer of <span class="bold">Iron(II) Oxide</span> rust.
                            The planet is one of the
                            brightest objects in the Solar System and can be seen with the naked eyes, to the point
                            where astronomers from the ancient times were able to document its bright red glow long
                            before telescopes existed.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Time Moves Differently on Mars.</h3>
                        <p>A day on Mars is very similar in length to Earth, about 24 hours and 37 minutes long.
                            However, a year on Mars is almost twice as long since it orbits further away from the Sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>Just like Earth, Mars also has four seasons due to the scarily similar axial tilt (about 25
                            degrees) to Earth (23 degrees). Coupled with the longer Martian year, this makes each season
                            lasts about two times more.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Double Trouble.</h3>
                        <p>Unlike Earth, Mars has two moons: Phobos and Deimos, and they're less rounded than their next
                            door satellite cousin. Phobos, the larger moon, is actually spiralling towards Mars and is
                            predicted
                            to crash into the planet in about 50 million years. This is a spectacular, yet quite frankly
                            terrifying, sight to see.</p>

                <h2>Welcome to the age of space travelling &#129680;</h2>
                <p>With rapid technological advancements, our vision to expand into space is closer than ever. Humanity
                    could expect to attempt space travelling by the 2040s at the earliest, and once success is certain
                    the possibilities are endless. But first of all, a crucial question:</p>
                <h3>Why Mars?</h3>
                <p>While other planets are either gas giants, acidic wastelands, or freezing hellscapes, Mars stands out
                    as the most viable candidate for future colonization. A few reasons why:</p>
                <ul class="grid grid-2 grid-gap-20 pad-tb-20">
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">A relatively managable atmosphere:</span> Mars has a thin
                        atmosphere made up
                        of mostly CO<sub>2</sub> gas, and while it's lacking oxygen, it's still a lighter lift to
                        transform habitable compared to other planets.</li>
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">Frozen water reserves:</span> Mars has ice caps at its poles,
                        and there's
                        evidence of water in the form of ice and vapour in the planet's soil. This is a crucial element
                        for sustaining life (and opens up a whole new area on the study of previous or current life on
                        Mars).</li>
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">A similar day-night cycle:</span>As mentioned, Mars has a day
                        that's only 37 minutes
                        longer than Earth's, and a year that's almost twice as long. This makes it easier to adapt to
                        the Martian day-night cycle.</li>
                    <li class="pad-20"><span class="bold">Sustainable gravity:</span> Mars has a surface gravity of
                        about 38% of Earth's. This is enough to prevent muscle and bone loss, but also light
                        enough to make it easier to travel and explore the planet.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="home-section-4 max-width pad-tb-100 pad-lr-20">
            <div class="grid grid-2 grid-gap-20">
                <div>
                    <h3>The road is long...</h3>
                    <p>Despite all the advantages, the road to Mars is still long and full of challenges. Mars'
                        conditions
                        are still vastly different from Earth's, and habitability will require extensive technological
                        advancements long before we can call this planet our second home.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Temperature:</span> Mars is extremely cold. The average temperature on Mars is
                        -62
                        degrees Celsius, due to the thin atmosphere and the planet's distance from the Sun. To make Mars
                        habitable, we would need to find a way to warm up the planet, or survive entirely indoors.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Radiation:</span> Mars' thin atmosphere also means that the planet is exposed
                        to
                        extremely high levels of radiation from the Sun. This is a major health risk for any potential
                        colonists, and we would need to find a way to shield ourselves from this radiation.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Resources:</span> While Mars has water and carbon dioxide, it lacks many of
                        the
                        resources that we take for granted on Earth: no oil, no easy-to-access oxygen, no fertile soil.
                        We
                        would have to mine ice for water, produce and sustain oxygen, and grow food using hydroponic
                        methods.</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Isolation:</span> Mars is a long way from Earth, and any colonists would be
                        cut
                        off from their home planet for long periods of time. This isolation could have serious
                        psychological
                        effects on the mind, and strong mental health support is a must.</p>

                    <h3>...but the wait is worth it.</h3>
                    <p>Despite the challenges, humanity always find a way to push boundaries. Mars colonization sounds
                        unimaginable today, but so did space travel itself just a century ago.</p>

                    <p>Every challenge brings new innovationsâ€”radiation shielding, self-sustaining habitats, AI-assisted
                        space farmingâ€”that could not only make Mars habitable but also advance life on Earth.</p>

                    <p>The road to Mars is long, uncertain, and filled with risks. But every great journey in human
                        historyâ€”sailing across oceans, exploring the poles, reaching the Moonâ€”was once thought
                        impossible.
                        Mars is our next great destination, and there is hope in one day where we can point at our sky
                        and
                        say "That's where our second home is."</p>
